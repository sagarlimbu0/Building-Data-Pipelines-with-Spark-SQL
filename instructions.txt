## Setting up docker compose environment

# 1. create directories to mount with airflow containers
=>
    mkdir -p ./dags ./config ./logs ./plugins 

# 2. Create Airflow User Id, which will be assigned via environment
# if Airflow User Id not created, the files will be OWNED by root
# Also creating Airflow User Id allows to control permissions of Airlfow Users
# this can also be configured via `.env` files

=>
    echo -e "AIRFLOW_UID=$(id -u)" > .env

# Build customized docker image from Dockerfile
# we can comment image in docker compose file and instrcut to build with '.'
EG: //to comment the image section in docker compose and follow the steps
=> 
    # image:${AIRFLOW_IMAGE_NAME: -apache/airflow:2.9.1}
    build: .

    ADD requirements.txt .
    RUN pip install apache_airflow=${AIRFLOW_VERSION} -r requirements.txt
